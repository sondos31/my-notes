# short paragraph about the good mindset of developers
As the writer said in the article in order to be a focused succesful programmer you have to be clear and know what you are about to do ...

There is ***no*** point in making the code long and complicated , **simplicity is always the right thing to choose** over complixty *"The source of many software failures is complexity"* .
Having a clear sorted code lines is one of the small things that helps you as a programmer to come back again and edit whatever you want if needed .. ***EASILY***
Probably one of the most importan things to do is setting our prioritizings infront of us and alwasy ask ourselves these questions :

1. **The desirability of a change (D):** How much do you want that change to happen?

2. **The value of a change (V):** How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?

3. **The effort required to perform the change (E):** How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?

so then the formula becomes like this as the writer mentioned ***D=V/E***
